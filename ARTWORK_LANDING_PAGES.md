# Artwork Landing Pages - Implementation Guide

## üé® What's Been Created

I've built a complete **artwork landing page system** that transforms each piece in your gallery into a professional showcase with certificate of authenticity. Each artwork now has its own dedicated page that serves as both a portfolio piece and a certificate.

## üìÅ New Files Created

### 1. **Artwork Landing Page Template**

  - Interactive like button with heart animation
  - Artist's story section with elegant typography
  - Complete certificate of authenticity
  - Preorder functionality integration

### 2. **Individual Artwork API**

### 4. **Enhanced Gallery Integration**

## üîó How It Works

### **URL Structure**

- Gallery: `https://timwatts.art/gallery`
- API endpoint: `https://timwatts.art/api/artworks/1`

### **Navigation Flow**
1. **Gallery Page**: Users browse artwork thumbnails
2. **Click/Tap**: Artwork cards link to individual landing pages
3. **Landing Page**: Full showcase with story and certificate
4. **Actions**: Like, order prints, or return to gallery

### **Data Structure**
```typescript
{
  id: number;
  title: string;
  medium: string;
  image_path: string;
  available: boolean;
  preorder: boolean;
  likes: number;
  story?: string;           // NEW: Artist's narrative
  dimensions?: string;      // NEW: Physical size
  year?: number;           // NEW: Creation year
  technique?: string;      // NEW: Artistic technique
  inspiration?: string;    // NEW: Creative inspiration
  certificate_id?: string; // NEW: Unique certificate ID
}
```

## üìä Database Setup

### **Step 1: Run Migration**
Execute the SQL in `database-migration.sql` in your Neon database console:

```sql
-- Add new columns
ALTER TABLE artworks 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS story TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS dimensions VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS year INTEGER,
-- ... (see full file for complete migration)
```

### **Step 2: Add Content**
Update your artworks with stories and details:

```sql
UPDATE artworks SET 
  story = 'Your artistic narrative here...',
  year = 2024,
  dimensions = '24" x 36"',
  technique = 'Digital mixed media',
  inspiration = 'Your inspiration here...'
WHERE id = 1;
```

## üéØ Sample Landing Page URLs

Once you run the migration and add content, each artwork will have its own landing page:

- **Artwork 1**: `http://localhost:3000/artwork/1`
- **Artwork 2**: `http://localhost:3000/artwork/2`
- **Artwork 3**: `http://localhost:3000/artwork/3`
