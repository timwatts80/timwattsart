                    I don't approach the work as something to be completed or resolved.
                    I stay with it until it no longer asks to be shaped.

                    The lines that make up the work are not planned in advance. They accumulate through attention;
                    through repetition, hesitation, and return. What matters to me isn't what the work communicates,
                    but what happens while staying with it.

                    I’m not interested in turning creativity into performance, identity, or outcome. I’m interested
                    in the quiet shift that occurs when attention is allowed to remain without direction and how
                    that same quality of attention carries beyond the work itself.
