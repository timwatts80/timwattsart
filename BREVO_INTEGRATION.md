# Brevo Newsletter Integration - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What I've Implemented

### 1. **Brevo API Endpoint** (`/src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts`)
- Created a new API endpoint at `/api/newsletter` 
- Integrates with Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) API
- Adds email subscribers to your Brevo contact list (List ID: 4)
- Handles duplicate contacts gracefully
- Uses environment variable for secure API key storage
- **NEW: Sends branded confirmation email to subscribers**
- **NEW: Sends notification email to sales@timwatts.art**

### 2. **Email Functionality**
- **Confirmation Email**: Beautiful branded HTML email sent to new subscribers
- **Notification Email**: Simple notification sent to sales@timwatts.art about new signups
- Both emails use professional HTML templates with fallback text versions
- Automatic email sending for both new and existing contacts

### 3. **Updated Stay Connected Form** (`/src/app/page.tsx`)
- Modified the email submission handler on the homepage
- Now sends data to `/api/newsletter` instead of Formspree
- Maintains the same user experience with success/error handling
- Triggers both emails automatically

### 4. **Updated Studio Journal Form** (`/src/app/studio-journal/page.tsx`)
- Updated the Studio Journal newsletter signup
- Now uses the same Brevo integration
- Consistent handling across both forms
- Also triggers email notifications

### 5. **Environment Configuration** (`.env`)
- Added `BREVO_API_KEY` to environment variables
- Secure storage of your API key
- Keeps sensitive data out of the codebase

2. Update the `listIds` array in `/src/app/api/newsletter/route.ts` if needed

### Contact Attributes
Currently captures:
- Email (required)

## üß™ Testing
You can test the integration by:
1. Visiting http://localhost:3000
2. Scrolling to the "Stay Connected" section

4. Checking your Brevo dashboard for the new contact
